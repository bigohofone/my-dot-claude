    The panel is the data area inside the axes spines; tick labels, axis labels, titles,

    on a figure that uses constrained layout. `ax` is an Axes, an array or list of Axes, or
    the dict from `subplot_mosaic`. Hidden axes and colorbar axes are skipped. If panels have
    different widths, the first panel is fitted. Returns the final panel ratios.

    Auto ticks can change with the height (e.g. 75, 80 → 77.5, 80.0), which changes the tick
    label width and so the panel width. If that keeps the ratio from converging, the major
    ticks are fixed at their current positions and the height is solved again.

    Never save with `bbox_inches="tight"`: it changes the final size and breaks the width and
    the ratio this function set.
